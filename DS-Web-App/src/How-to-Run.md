Quick and Dirty how to run the app:
To run our beautiful web app, you will need to run the command:
		
npm start

in this directory.
What's npm? Its the node package manager that is provided by Node.js,
please install node.js if you haven't already so that you'll be able to use it.
This will run the react script that will eventually run the app, at 
least for development purposes. There may also be some more react components
that may need to be installed, so you might need to run:

npm install -g create-react-app

if you're interested in creating react stuff. Let me know if there are any
other questions, I know I'm kinda dumping all of this on you now.
